# Location-Analysis

This script is a try to get a detailled analysis about ~500k geolocations like discontinued Google Latitude did it.

## Planned analysis

* Percentage of time spent at home, work and on the road in last week and last month
* Visits in various locations
  * A visit is to stay at a location within N meters for at least M minutes without leaving this zone
* Distance travelled compared to the distance to the moon or other astronomical objects
